# Cellular automata Android application

### Computer Science BSc thesis project

I made this application to simulate one-dimensional and two-dimensional cellular automatas.

One-dimensional simulation features:
- Change the ruleset between 0-255
- Set the generation size
- Set pre-defined or custom-made starting position
- Freely move the cellsheet in every direction, ability to zoom
- Generate more generations at once

Two-dimensional simulation features:
- Change the size of the cellsheet
- Rules work by the number of neighbors
- Ability to freely change the state of the cellsheet
- Freely move the cellsheet in every direction, ability to zoom
